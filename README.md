# Simple JQuery-Cart-Page

The cart page has a two column layout. The first column has the items (items' JSON data provided at the end) while the second one displays the total price container. The initial quantity of each item is 1.

The user can delete the items from the cart.

Provide extra discount of 15% to the items with “type” value as “fiction”. So, an item with "type" value as "fiction" should have a total discount of type discount + normal discount on its "price" value.
